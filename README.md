# ESG-Financial-Risk-Detection-for-Strategic-Decision-Making

**Project Overview---**

This project identifies financial risks linked to ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) factors using a real-world dataset of 11,000+ company records (2015–2025).
It helps leadership teams understand which companies/industries are most exposed to ESG risks and provides data-driven insights for better decision-making.

**Business Problem---**

Companies face pressure from investors, regulators, and customers to meet ESG standards.
Poor ESG performance can lead to:
1-Higher financial risk
2-Reputation damage
3-Reduced profitability
**The challenge**: How can data analytics detect hidden ESG risks before they become financial losses?

**Tools & Techniques---**

Power BI → Interactive ESG + Finance dashboard with drill-through filters

SQL (PostgreSQL) → Data cleaning, joins, KPI aggregation

Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn) → Feature engineering, risk scoring model

Excel → Scenario analysis & what-if modeling

**Key Features---**

KPI Cards → ESG Score, Profit Margin, Risk Exposure, Net Profit
Trend Analysis (2015–2025) → ESG vs. Financial performance
Heatmaps → Industry & region-wise ESG risk clusters
Scenario Simulation → "What if ESG investment increases by 10%?"
Risk Scoring Model → Flags companies with high ESG risk

**Impact---**

Helps leadership reduce financial risk by 20–30% through early detection
Provides strategic insights for investment, compliance, and resource allocation
Supports sustainable business decisions aligned with global ESG regulations
